#template-service

This is a RESTFUL web service used to track users and their rewards points. 
It serves as a template for a Spring boot java microservice.

It has several useful endpoints:

####Creating a User

The endpoint `/api/v1/users` allows for the creation of new users.

It requires a `first name`, `last name`, and `email address`, included as path variables on the request.

Example call to create a user:
`curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/users" -H "accept: */*" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{ \"emailAddress\": \"email@gmail.com\", \"firstName\": \"Wombat\", \"lastName\": \"Gumbo\"}"`


####Creating a Transfer

A transfer is a change to the amount of points a user has.
One can be generated by calling `/api/v1/transfers` with a `userId`, `action` (ADD or REMOVE), and `amount`.

Example call to create a transfer: 
`curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/transfers" -H "accept: */*" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{ \"action\": \"ADD\", \"amount\": 4, \"userId\": 2}"`

NOTE: Transactions can only be created for users that exist, and REMOVE transactions cannot be created for users that will leave them with negative points.

####Listing Transfers for a User

Transfers for a User's ID can be retrieved at the `/api/v1/list/transfers/{userId}`

Example call: `curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/transfers/1" -H "accept: */*"`

###Running the Service Locally

adam-service utilizes docker-compose to bring up the service container and the database container in parallel. 
Because of the docker network, it is necessary for the `spring.datasource.url` property in `src/main/resource/application.properties`
to reference the docker bridge IP on the docker host. 

Simply run: `docker-compose up`

It is also possible to run the service locally outside of a container with gradle:
    
    * Change the datasource URL to localhost, ex: spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:6432/service
    * Run the database container by running the build-and-start.sh script in /database
    * Run the service with ./gradlew bootRun in the root project directory


####Swagger Docs
Swagger documentation of the available endpoints is automatically generated with springfox.

It is available at `localhost:8080`
